		<h1>My name is Sandhya Kumari.</h1>

		 Everybody remembers and recollect the childhood days with pleasure even through one suffered agony or enjoyed pleasure in the younger days.
		 Childhood is a period of innocence and parity.
		</p>
		<p>
			I was born in Patna,Bihar and brought up in a very adorable family.My father is a business and My mother is household lady.I have grown up with my elder brother with whom i played alot.<br>
			I still remember some beautiful memories of school playing games like Flames , Truth and Dare ,Dumbsharas , Pen Fighting, Badminton and many more.....
		</p>
		<p>
			Now , My hobbies are listening Music , cooking and taste variety of foods , travelling and explore the new things.
            As I have taken admission in N.I.F.T in 2021 , I made lots of Plan for travelling ,some of my favourite places like shimla , manali , goa , kedarnath , vaishnodevi , jaipur but due to this pandemic unable to travel any of the place. All trips were postponed
